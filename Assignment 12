;Assignment 12 Chapter 4.10 Programming Exercise 8

;Using a loop and indexed addressing, write code that rotates the members of a 32-bit integer array 
;forward one position.  The value at the end of the array must wrap around to the first position.  
;For example, the array [10,20,30,40] would be transformed into [40,10,20,30]
